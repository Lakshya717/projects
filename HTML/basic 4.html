            ID selectors are a way to give a name to a html element that is unique, classes provide a way to give name to the 
            html elements that are not unique and infact follow uniformity.

            <h1>Specificity</h1>
            Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most relevant to an 
            element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity algorithm calculates 
            the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule <b>from competing CSS declarations</b> gets applied to an element.
            <ol>
                <li>inline</li>
                <li>id</li>
                <li>class</li>
                <li>type</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="special1"><b>Note:</b> that the order in which the css property is defined doesn't matter.
            As you can see as soon as an inline css property was defined it overruled the existing properties of div and its refering
            class "basic" </p>

            <h1>CSS selectors</h1>
            Now there are various different types of CSS selectors.
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Selector</th><th>Comments</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a, b</td>
                        <td>Multiple element Selector</td>
                        
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a b</td>
                        <td>Descendant Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a > b</td>
                        <td>Child Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a + b</td>
                        <td>Adjacent Sibling Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[a=b]</td>
                        <td>Attribute Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a:b</td>
                        <td>Pseudoclass Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>a::b</td>
                        <td>Psuedoelement Selector</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        
            Using some of these selectors one by one in the following way:
            <h2>Child Selector</h2>
            Child selector: <b>"a > b"</b> applies proeprty specified to the element <b>b</b> contained just inside <b>a</b>
            (i.e. only when it is the direct child of a)
            <ol>
                <li>list item one</li>
                <li>list item two</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>sublist item one</li>
                    <li>sublist item two</li>
                </ul>
                <li>list item three</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <h2>Descendent Selector</h2>
            Descendent selector: <b>"a  b"</b> applies proeprty specified to the element <b>b</b> when it is contained inside <b>a</b>
            (i.e. all elements b which are simply inside of a)

            <hr>
            <h2>Attribute Selector</h2>
            used to identify tags with specific attribute
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Google.com">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="amazon.com">amazon</a></li>
                <li><a href="facebook.com">facebook</a> ----Here specifically attribute with this link has been colored red</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>
            <h2>Pseudoclass Selectors</h2>
            A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.
            <br>
            <button>Click me!</button>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> On hovering the color is different and on clicking also it is different.
